    <section><pre>There are many definitions for GitHub around the web. GitHub is a "cloud social network for 
programmers and a collaboration platform for developers, which is the world's largest repository 
for shared and distributed work."

GitHub was created as the largest host for hosting projects that use the Git version control system.

Overflow Stack is not a forum like other programming forums. Rather, it is a question and answer service
that helps you to finally get the answer to any question you have in a few minutes. If we want to say 
what Stack Overflow is, I believe that Stackoverflow and Google are the best friends of every programmer
and for programmers. It is considered a paradise. This site is all that every programmer and designer needs.</pre></section>
